## Gym Management System

A frontend react js application for gym management

## Quick start

1. Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
   *We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default, if you wish to force `npm` usage do: `USE_YARN=false npm run setup`*<br />
   *At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.*
2. Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app.

Now you're ready to rumble!
